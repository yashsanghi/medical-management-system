## Summary

- The users/admin/medical store owner runs our application. The application prompts the client to either log in as a user or an admin or a medical store owner.
If the user is already registered, they simply enter their bitsID and password, if not they need to sign up by providing details like bitsID, phone number, email address, and name.

- After the user is logged in he can book an appointment with any doctor thatâ€™s available on the notice board. 
- A notice board can be accessed by both user and admin but can be modified by the admin only. The Notice board contains information about all the available slots for the doctors.
- Users can select any of the available slots to book an appointment with the doctor. The user also has the option to view a list of his/her appointments. If the user finds an empty time slot to book an appointment, he can book that slot, and the list and notice board will be updated. If the user enters a time slot that has already been taken, he is prompted to book another time slot or perform other tasks.
- The user can also purchase medicine from the medical store by either paying directly or by the pay later option.
- The admin has the option to view the list of all the users. He can also update the notice board, and can also view the appointments for the day.
- The medical store owner can view the inventory, update the inventory and review all the statistics related to his revenue, due amount etc.
